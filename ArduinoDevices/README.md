# Legacy library examples

Early development of this project was solely on small micro-controller devices.  Not all of the devices used in early testing are sufficiently powerful to support a final implementation with a Coordinator and an Application.

Mid-project development has shifted to virtualized devices and final targeted devices remains open.

It is expected to go back to some micro-controller device(s) in final stages -- probably something that can be targeted directly with clang/llvm where builds and unit tests are performed automatically to all targets.

Expect a range of target devices as a Thermostat with human interface devices has different requirements than a zone controller.
